## TV ratings chart

This application lets users get an overview of the ratings of each episode of their favourite TV show by displaying the ratings in line charts.
You can see how the ratings evolve with the seasons, compare seasons against each other, or put all seasons together to see trends throughout the show.

This application uses IMDb's own [non-commercial datasets](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/) together with the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
