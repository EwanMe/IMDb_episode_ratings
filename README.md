https://imdbseriesratings.netlify.app/

This is a personal project to let users get an overview of the ratings of each episode of their favourite TV show by displaying the ratings in a line chart. You can see how the ratings evolve with the seasons and compare seasons against each other.

This web application uses the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to retrieve information and ratings of shows from the [Internet Movie Database](https://www.imdb.com/).
